# QR-Genarator
This Python script generates a QR code using the qrcode library. The QR code encodes a URL, and the image is saved as 'qrcode_image_link.png'. The script uses error correction, custom box size, and border settings to ensure readability. Modify the image_url variable to use your own link. Simple and customizable!
